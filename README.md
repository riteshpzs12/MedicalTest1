# Docr: Online Doctor Appointment Booking
This is a project to create system for online doctor's appointment booking. The project has a backend (written in Express) for handling the database and backend APIs with MongoDB and a frontend cross-platform --- Android, iOS, Windows --- application (written in Xamarin). 
The project is **still under construction**. The over plan is the following:

An admin can create accounts for doctors to the system. Doctors will be sent a link (over SMS/email) to complete their profile, set time when they want to see patients and their calendar who are scheduled. 
The patients can register themselves, create their profile, add prior medical history (if any), add prior reports, etc. They can search for doctors after filtering based on their requirements, and book appointments with a doctor. Patients can also quickly chat with trained professionals to help find doctors and complete the booking.



## Code Structure
Need to finish.


## How to run?
Run the server using the following command.
```bash
$ 
```

You can test the app by installing it in your phone and connecting the phone to the same wifi network as the server.
